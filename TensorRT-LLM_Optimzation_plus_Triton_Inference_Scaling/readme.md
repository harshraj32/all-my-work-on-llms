# LLM Deployment Guide: TensorRT-LLM and Triton Inference Server

This guide walks you through deploying an LLM using NVIDIA's TensorRT-LLM for optimization and Triton Inference Server for scaling. I've structured this as a comprehensive tutorial that explains each component and how they work together.

## Understanding the Stack

### TensorRT-LLM
TensorRT-LLM is NVIDIA's inference optimization library specifically designed for Large Language Models. It:
- Optimizes transformer architectures through kernel fusion
- Supports quantization (FP16, INT8, INT4)
- Enables tensor parallelism for multi-GPU deployment
- Provides specialized kernels for attention mechanisms

### Triton Inference Server
Triton is NVIDIA's model serving platform that:
- Manages multiple models and versions
- Handles scaling and load balancing
- Provides dynamic batching for throughput optimization
- Offers a unified API layer for all models

## Step-by-Step Deployment Process

### 1. Model Export
We start by exporting a Hugging Face model (`facebook/opt-125m` in this example) to a format that TensorRT-LLM can work with:

```python
# Export model from Hugging Face
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("facebook/opt-125m")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/opt-125m")

# Save model weights in TensorRT-LLM compatible format
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    torch.save(param.data, os.path.join(output_dir, f"{name}.pt"))
```

This gives us the raw model weights that TensorRT-LLM will optimize.

### 2. TensorRT-LLM Engine Building

Next, we build a TensorRT engine from these exported weights:

```python
# Define model configuration
config = LLMConfig(
    vocab_size=50272,  # Model-specific parameters
    hidden_size=768,
    num_hidden_layers=12,
    num_attention_heads=12,
    max_seq_length=2048
)

# Create and configure the TensorRT builder
builder = Builder()
network = builder.create_network()
builder_config = builder.create_builder_config(
    precision="fp16",  # Can be fp16, int8, etc.
    max_batch_size=8,
    max_input_len=512,
    max_output_len=128
)

# Build and save the engine
engine = builder.build_engine(network, builder_config)
with open(engine_path, "wb") as f:
    f.write(engine)
```

This compilation process:
1. Analyzes the model structure
2. Fuses operations when possible
3. Optimizes memory access patterns
4. Creates specialized CUDA kernels
5. Produces a highly optimized binary engine file

### 3. Triton Model Configuration

For Triton to serve our TensorRT engine, we need a `config.pbtxt` file:

```
name: "opt_tensorrt_llm"
platform: "tensorrt_plan"
max_batch_size: 8

input [
  {
    name: "input_ids"
    data_type: TYPE_INT32
    dims: [ -1 ]  # Variable sequence length
  }
]

output [
  {
    name: "output_ids"
    data_type: TYPE_INT32
    dims: [ -1 ]
  }
]

instance_group [
  {
    count: 1  # Number of model instances to load
    kind: KIND_GPU
    gpus: [ 0 ]  # Which GPUs to use
  }
]

dynamic_batching {
  preferred_batch_size: [ 4, 8 ]
  max_queue_delay_microseconds: 50000
}
```

This configuration:
- Defines input/output tensor shapes and types
- Sets up dynamic batching for higher throughput
- Configures how many model instances to load
- Specifies which GPUs to use

### 4. Inference Client

Finally, we create a client to interact with Triton:

```python
# Create Triton client
client = triton_http.InferenceServerClient(url="localhost:8000")

# Prepare input
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(text, return_tensors="np").astype(np.int32)

# Create inference request
inputs = [
    triton_http.InferInput("input_ids", input_ids.shape, "INT32")
]
inputs[0].set_data_from_numpy(input_ids)

outputs = [
    triton_http.InferRequestedOutput("output_ids")
]

# Send request
response = client.infer(model_name, inputs, outputs=outputs)

# Process result
output_ids = response.as_numpy("output_ids")
output_text = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0])
```

## Deployment Strategies

### Single GPU Deployment
The simplest setup is a single GPU deployment:
- Build one TensorRT engine
- Configure Triton with one GPU instance
- Suitable for lower traffic or smaller models

### Multi-GPU Scale-Out
For higher throughput:
- Build identical engines for each GPU
- Configure Triton with multiple instance groups
- Triton automatically load balances between GPUs

### Tensor Parallelism (Large Models)
For models too large for a single GPU:
- Use TensorRT-LLM's tensor parallelism feature
- Split model layers across GPUs
- Requires specialized configuration in both TensorRT-LLM and Triton

## Performance Tuning

Key parameters to adjust:
- **Precision**: FP16 balances accuracy and speed; INT8/INT4 for higher throughput
- **Batch Size**: Larger batches typically improve throughput
- **Sequence Length**: Limit to what you actually need for efficiency
- **Dynamic Batching**: Adjust queue delay based on your latency requirements

## Monitoring and Debugging

Triton provides metrics at:
- `/metrics` endpoint (Prometheus compatible)
- Key metrics: throughput, queue time, compute time
- Model status at `/v2/models/{model_name}/stats`

## Next Steps

To further improve your deployment:
1. Implement proper error handling and retries
2. Add model versioning and A/B testing
3. Set up monitoring and alerting
4. Consider quantization for improved throughput
5. Experiment with different batching strategies
